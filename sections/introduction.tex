\section{Introduction}
With the introduction of the internet, the availability and sheer amount of information of data has increased dramatically. No longer can one manually determine the overal sentiment or opinion of a given entity. Every internet user has the ability to publish an opinion on any given entity. This results in an effectively limitless amount of text documents, the majority of which having no means to tabulate with the aid of computing, being natural language. Being able to easily determine the sentiment of a document (whether its general mood is positive, negative, or neutral) toward its subject or a given entity would have many applications. Being able to determine the general consensus of something is incredibly useful for both producers and consumers of products, and for social scholars.

This project attempts to create a system that accurately estimates the sentiment of a textual product review using machine learning techniques. The completed system does provide an estimate of the overall rating of a product based on a text review, however whether it does so accurately enough to be useful is still in question.
