\section{Conclusion}
While the results may not have been as favorable as one would like, this system does analyze the sentiment of textual documents, achieving a greater than a random guess's 50\% accuracy rating. The system certainly needs adjustments to be brought up to par with much larger scale sentiment analysis systems, however it is deemed a successful exploration experience for the scope of this project.
